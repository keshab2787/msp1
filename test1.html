        Sometimes when i think about all of this i like to actually think my brother was more excited 
        than me about me doing this bootcamp and i like to think that because i know that is actually 
        right. So on the day of May 20th 2019 at 8:30 am, i started driving towards my destination, my
        class to take the first step of becoming a <strong>Web Developer</strong>. As i was driving i
        remembered i had to pick up my friend <strong>carlos</strong> from his house as he called and texted
        me the night before, so i tried to call him but his phone was not working. At that moment i thought
        about reading his text as i still hadnt read it, so while i was reading his text i realized he did
        tell me that his phone was broken. So i called the number from which he texted me to let me know his
        phone was broken. After not getting a reply i texted that number and as it turns out that was his
        girlfriend <strong>Ashley</strong> and she gave me an address but did told me he might have left as i was 
        a little late. Ashley told me if you dont see the <strong>Toyota Camry</strong> in the driveway the chances
        are he drove. I thanked Ashley for the prompt reply and i did contemplated on going to his house to pick
        him up or going to class and not be late but since i already gave him my word i just went ahead with keeping
        my word and as expected he was not there. I did got a little disappointed but i do understood where he is 
        coming from so i started driving to <strong>msp1</strong>. I got into the parking lot of Amazon and i noticed 
        there was more than usual cars in the parking lot, so i circled twice before finding the parking spot i 
        like. I scanned my badge, got inside the building and proceeded to the classroom. I was actually thinking 
        its gonna be a little difficult to find the <strong>Career Choice Classroom</strong> but it was the easiest
        thing of all time. I got inside the classroom and saw about 40 people with the instructor and the 
        person from the <strong>hr</strong>, they were sorting out computers to hand out to students and had a puzzled 
        look on their faces. I saw an open spot between <strong>carlos</strong>and this other random guy so i went ahead
        and took that spot and started talking to <strong>carlos</strong> about how i went to his house to pick him up
        and him not being there. <strong>carlos</strong> began to apologize saying it was late and so he had to leave 
        and i was like "hey dont worry about that bud". The random guy who was sitting next to me was little chubby
        and had a peculiar way of annoying people that you dont realize at first but it really gets to you in just
        a little while or at leat thats what i thought. He started talking about how he built a server in his house
        when he was a kid and how tech savvy he is, he started talking about <strong>qbasic</strong> and <strong>qbasic</strong>
        being something i know i started listening to him and thats when i realized he was talking out of his ass
        but i was not annoyed by him at that point as i do the same thing a lot of the time. After giving all the
        students a laptop the instructor began to introduce himself by talking about his name, what he did for living
        and that sort of introductory things. I just started looking at my brand new laptop, and the minute i looked
        at that laptop resentment towards the company sinked in. The computer had a intel pentium processor in 
        this modern tech era with a processing speed of 1.10 Ghz. 1.10 GHz , are you kidding me?. I started talking 
        about how the processing speed in only 1.10 ghz to the random guy next to me and we did had some good laugh
        as he told me he used 1.10 ghz in the early 2000s and i thought while thats not entirely impossible, it is 
        impossible as internet was just sprouting if you know what i mean and 1.10 ghz was the luxury for programmers
        and rich people , not people like us, the ordinary people. "so student" i heard my instructor raising his 
        voice so that everybody could hear "as i said my name is <strong>Sean Maher</strong>, i mostly work as an independent
        contractor as a consultant but in the past i did worked at bunch of companies including <strong>General Motors</strong>, that being the 
        longest of my career. I discovered the web in early 90s, late 80s when i was going to college which made me
        drop out of college and pursue just this the full time and i did pursued to the full extent. I did worked building
        websites for airport too. By the end of this course you will be able to code and its just about practice."</div>

        By the same time my instructor was talking a beautiful girl walked in and everybody in the class just
        turned around which prompted that beautiful girl to say "dont mind me, i will be in and out and smiled."
        "Attention Everyone my name is <strong>Callie Robar</strong> and on the behalf of American Consortium of Colleges, 
        we welcome all of you in this class, as you are going to gain valuable skills from this class at the end 
        of this semester we want you to explore other ventures whether it be in or outside amazon and i am here to 
        make that dream possible for you guys.So if you guys have any questions, concerns, how we are going to place 
        you just shoot me an email and remember guys my name is <strong>Callie Robar</strong>. Thank you Guys." 
        After that she came up to me and i was in awe to the reason why she came up to me but hey i was happy
        "Do you have that voucher with you?" callie asked me. "umhhhhh.....vou..che..errr, i was so busy checking
        her out i totally forgot what she was talking about and what she wanted". "Yup the voucher from Amazon
        that paid for this class", Callie replied. Oh the voucher yeah, i dont have it with me but i can go print
        it right away. "could you please do that?" callie asked me. So i got out of the classroom and walked towards
        the HR desk as there were a lot of computers and they had printers too. I logged in using my sign-in ID
        and printed the voucher, and this is funny but the whole time i was printing that voucher i was only thinking
        about callie's legs, oh man those legs looked fine, no pun intended.</div>
        <br>

        <div style="background-color:blue">
            With the voucher in my hand i hurried back to the class and talked to callie for one last time 
            and handed her the voucher. "Thank you Kes...sab, did i say that right? i am sorry if i butchered 
            your name". She did butchered my name as its pronounced <strong>keshab</strong> but i was definitely 
            not going to tell her that, as i was amazed by her beauty. "Hey, couldnt be better than that, you did 
            amazing, thats my name " i replied back. She gave me one big smile and she left the room, as it turns out 
            she was just waiting for me to get that voucher to get out of the class. i really thought it meant something
            but i was also sure that it was a petty coincidence. "Man that girl is hot", carlos said laughing
            "yup she is, i am questioning my relationship now" i replied and carlos went "hahaha, same here bro."
            "Okay class, lets talk about the syllabus, the book and how i am going to go about everything" <strong>Sean</strong>
            my instructor
